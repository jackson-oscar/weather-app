## Description

The weather app returns current weather and a five day forecast for the location entered. The more specific the search the better the results. For example, searching "Seattle WA" instead of "Seattle," or ZIP code, helps get the location desired. The weather data shown is temperature in fahrenheit, description of weather, weather picture, and the day's high and low temperatures.
